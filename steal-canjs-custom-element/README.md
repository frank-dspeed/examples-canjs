# What is that?

Some experiments with canjs and steal at a time where can-element did not exist this was the base to invent it.

## This is a old example
Today you should use can/core.mjs as dependencie and rollup to bundle that then you do not need babel element in the build directly as it is done here for pleasing steal.

It mainly shows that you can use can stache directly inside customElements. Not More Not Less
